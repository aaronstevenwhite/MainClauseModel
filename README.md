# Main Clause Model

## Overview

This package implements the model of syntactic bootstrapping described in [White, Hacquard, & Lidz 2017](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_main_2017.pdf). This model is a modification of two other models: one described in [White 2015](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_information_2015.pdf) and one described in [White & Rawlins 2016](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_computational_2016_salt.pdf). The data found in `bin/data/gleason_data.csv` was extracted based on an algorithm described in [White, Resnik, Hacquard, & Lidz under review](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_contextual_2016.pdf).
